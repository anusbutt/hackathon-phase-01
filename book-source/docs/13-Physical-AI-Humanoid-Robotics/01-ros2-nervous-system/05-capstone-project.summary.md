# Capstone Project: Design a Delivery Robot System - Summary

**Quick Reference**: Integrative project overview

## Project Goal

Design a complete autonomous delivery robot system integrating all four lesson concepts: ROS2 architecture (Lesson 1), node communication patterns (Lesson 2), Python rclpy code (Lesson 3), and URDF robot modeling (Lesson 4).

## Required Deliverables

1. **Node Architecture Diagram** (25 pts): 4-6 nodes with clear responsibilities and ROS2 graph connections
2. **Communication Design** (25 pts): 5-7 topics/services with pattern justifications (topics for continuous data, services for requests)
3. **rclpy Code Outlines** (25 pts): Pseudocode for 2-3 nodes showing publishers, subscribers, callbacks, timers
4. **URDF Robot Structure** (25 pts): Physical robot design with links, joints, kinematic tree (base, wheels, sensors, cargo)
5. **Integration & Justification** (25 pts): Cohesive design with rationale based on ROS2 principles

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **System Architecture**: Breaking complex robot into modular nodes with single responsibilities
- **Pattern Selection**: Choosing topics (pub/sub) vs services (request/response) based on requirements
- **Code Structure**: Applying rclpy patterns (Node class, create_publisher, create_subscription, callbacks)
- **Robot Modeling**: Designing URDF kinematic structure (links, joints, parent-child relationships)
- **Systems Thinking**: Integrating multiple concepts into practical solution

## Assessment

Design exercise (not full implementation). Submit as Markdown/PDF with diagrams, justifications, and code outlines. Expect 2-3 hours for design and documentation. Passing: 70+ points. Exemplary: 90+ points.
