# Summary: Lesson 1 - Camera Systems and Computer Vision

**Module**: Module 2 - Sensors and Perception for Humanoid Robots
**Lesson**: 01-camera-systems.md
**Target Audience**: CS students with Python + Module 1 (ROS2) knowledge
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty**: Beginner

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. **Understand** the five foundational camera parameters (pixels, resolution, frame rate, field of view, image encoding)
2. **Differentiate** between monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras based on trade-offs
3. **Apply** ROS2 sensor_msgs/Image and CameraInfo message structures to process camera data
4. **Analyze** camera placement strategies (head, wrist, chest) and their impact on humanoid capabilities
5. **Evaluate** trade-offs in multi-camera system design for competing requirements

## Key Concepts Covered

### Camera Types (Section 3.1)
- **Monocular**: Simple, low-cost, no depth (2D only)
- **Stereo**: Passive depth via triangulation, 0.5-10m range
- **RGB-D**: Active depth (IR/ToF), 0.3-10m range, limited outdoor use

### Camera Parameters (Section 3.2)
- **Resolution**: 640×480 (VGA) to 4K, trade-off with computation
- **Field of View**: 30-180°, inverse relationship with focal length
- **Frame Rate**: 10-60+ FPS, trade-off with bandwidth

### Camera Placement (Section 3.3)
- **Head-mounted**: Navigation, situational awareness, pan/tilt capability
- **Wrist-mounted**: Manipulation, visual servoing, eye-in-hand
- **Chest-mounted**: Stable SLAM reference, compromise viewpoint

### ROS2 Integration (Sections 3.4-3.5)
- **sensor_msgs/Image**: header, dimensions, encoding, step, raw data
- **sensor_msgs/CameraInfo**: K matrix (intrinsics), distortion coefficients
- **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Camera driver → multiple vision nodes
- **QoS**: Best effort reliability, moderate queue depth for real-time

## Real-World Examples

### Boston Dynamics Atlas
- Stereo cameras in head (752×480 @ 30fps, 10cm baseline)
- RGB cameras in wrists (1280×720 @ 10-15fps)
- Task specialization: depth for locomotion, color for manipulation

### Tesla Optimus
- Eight monocular cameras (1280×960 @ 36fps)
- Vision-only approach (no lidar)
- Neural network depth estimation from monocular cues

## Code Examples

1. **CameraSubscriber**: Subscribe to /camera/image_raw and log metadata
2. **CameraInfoSubscriber**: Extract K matrix and calculate FOV from focal length

Both examples demonstrate:
- Type hints on all function signatures
- ROS2 node inheritance pattern
- Callback-based message processing
- Proper use of sensor_msgs types

## Practice Exercises

1. **Multi-Camera System Design**: Design vision system for delivery robot (navigation + object recognition + human interaction)
2. **Live Topic Inspection**: Use ros2 CLI tools to inspect camera topics and extract parameters
3. **AI Colearning Prompts**:
   - FOV/focal length relationship analogy
   - Stereo synchronization requirements

## Common Pitfalls (Expert Insights)

1. **Resolution Sweet Spot**: 640×480 @ 15-30fps often better than 4K for real-time humanoid applications
2. **RGB vs BGR**: OpenCV uses BGR by default; rgb8 messages need conversion to avoid color inversion

## Assessment Criteria

Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Explain camera type differences and justify selection for specific humanoid tasks
- Subscribe to ROS2 camera topics and process image/calibration data
- Design multi-camera configurations with trade-off justification
- Calculate FOV from intrinsic matrix parameters
- Identify appropriate camera placements for manipulation vs navigation

## Prerequisites

- Module 1: ROS2 Basics (nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, message types)
- Python 3.11+ with type hints
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices for K matrix understanding)

## Next Steps

- **Lesson 2**: Depth Sensing Technologies (LiDAR, structured light, ToF)
- **Connection**: Cameras provide 2D semantic info; depth sensors add 3D spatial awareness
