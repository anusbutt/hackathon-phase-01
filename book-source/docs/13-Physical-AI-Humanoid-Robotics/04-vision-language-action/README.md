# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Learning Platform! This module explores the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. You'll learn how to build systems that process voice commands, decompose natural language into robotic actions, integrate vision-language processing, and execute complete robotic tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- Apply cognitive planning with LLMs to translate natural language commands into action sequences
- Integrate vision-language systems for multimodal perception and object grounding
- Execute complete VLA pipelines from voice command to robot action

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: Sensors and Perception for Humanoid Robots
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Lessons

1. [Voice-to-Action Systems](./01-voice-to-action.md) - Introduction to speech recognition and Whisper API integration
2. [Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./02-cognitive-planning.md) - Using LLMs for natural language understanding and task decomposition
3. [Vision-Language Integration](./03-vision-language-integration.md) - Multimodal perception and language-grounded vision
4. [Action Execution and Control](./04-action-execution-control.md) - Complete VLA pipeline with ROS2 action servers
5. [Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid](./05-capstone-project.md) - Complete VLA task implementation
6. [Module Quiz](./06-quiz.md) - Assessment of VLA concepts and integration

## Key Concepts

- **Voice-to-Action**: Processing natural language commands through speech recognition
- **Cognitive Planning**: Decomposing high-level goals into executable action sequences
- **Vision-Language Integration**: Multimodal perception combining visual and linguistic information
- **Action Execution**: Safe and reliable execution of planned actions on robotic platforms

## Technology Stack

- OpenAI Whisper API for speech recognition
- Large Language Models (GPT, Claude) for cognitive planning
- Vision-Language models (CLIP, BLIP) for multimodal processing
- ROS2 Humble for action execution
- Isaac Sim for simulation environments

## Estimated Time

Completing all lessons, capstone project, and quiz should take approximately 6-8 hours depending on your prior experience with LLMs and multimodal systems.
