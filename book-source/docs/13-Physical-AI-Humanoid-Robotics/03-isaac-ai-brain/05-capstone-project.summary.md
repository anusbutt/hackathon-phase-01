# Capstone Project: Design Complete Autonomous Humanoid System - Summary

**Quick Reference**: Key concepts from the capstone project integrating all Isaac platform components

## Core Concept

Comprehensive design project requiring integration of Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 to create complete autonomous humanoid navigation system, demonstrating mastery of all Module 3 concepts.

## Key Points

- **System Integration**: Complete architecture combining simulation, perception, and navigation components
- **Design Requirements**: Specific requirements for Isaac Sim scene, Isaac ROS pipeline, and Nav2 configuration
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Rubric covering system architecture, component design, and integration strategy
- **Real-World Application**: Design for humanoid robot operating in complex indoor environments
- **Concept Synthesis**: Integration of all Isaac platform concepts from previous lessons

## When to Use

Use capstone project framework when demonstrating mastery of Isaac platform integration or designing complete autonomous systems for humanoid robots.

## Common Isaac Patterns

- End-to-end system design approach
- Component integration strategies
- Performance optimization across platform
- Failure handling and recovery design
